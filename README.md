# Kashyap's nvim Config

This is a config I built for personal usage with the help of plugins that I think are useful for development.

Languages that I frequently use:

 - Java
 - C++
 - Python

# Plugins Used

 1. LazyVim (For package management): https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim
 2. Gruvbox (Colorscheme): https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox
 3. Sidebar (For file management, git, and diagnostics): https://github.com/sidebar-nvim/sidebar.nvim
# Future Plans

 - Add lsp features for the languages mentioned
 - Add fuzzy finder
 - Add a nice look startup
 - UI elements
 - Logo
 - Font
 - File System

# Reference Links

Link to the possible plugins to be used. This resource is amazing since it has all types of nvim plugins from LSP's to colour themes. I will be using this for future plugins.
